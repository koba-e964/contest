### Library
Library is placed in `comm/`. In `comm/` files are separated by the following criteria:
```
comm/
|
|--comm/graph/ graph theory
|--comm/tree/ related to trees
|--comm/datastr/ data structures
|--comm/string/ string-related algorithms
|-- any other files
```

Furthermore, some files are place in `snippet/`. They are confirmed to work, but not suitable for drop-in use. (Core parts of implementation are not separated into functions/classes.)
